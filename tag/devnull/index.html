            2009-03-25          <p>Sigh. The ubiquitous utility <strong>less</strong> does a really bad and hard to understand
  thing. For some time now, it behaves not just as a reader but also a writer:
  it writes a history file (specified by the environment variable <code>LESSHISTFILE</code>
  which is <code>$HOME/.lesshst</code> by default). If <strong>you</strong> want less to be <strong>writing</strong>
  things, fine, but don&#39;t force it on <strong>me</strong>! This has caused some annoying
  problems that have been really hard to finally trace back to less.</p>
