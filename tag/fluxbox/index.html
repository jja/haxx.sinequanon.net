            2008-09-11          <p>The default Fluxbox startup file at <code>~/.fluxbox/startup</code> is run by
  startfluxbox and has embedded comments describing how to add applications
  (&quot;apps&quot;) to run before Fluxbox starts up. The startup file can be fixed to
  also run apps after Fluxbox starts or after Fluxbox finishes. You might run
  apps after Fluxbox startup to be sure that Fluxbox applies its window
  position/decoration settings or puts the programs in the slit. Running apps
  after Fluxbox finishes is useful to cleanup things that were started earlier.
  The example startup file given below covers both situations.</p>
