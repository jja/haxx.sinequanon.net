            2009-03-26          <p>Grails 1.1 has changed logging setup completely, introducing a
  <a href="http://grails.org/doc/1.1/guide/3.%20Configuration.html#3.1.2%20Logging">new DSL closure</a>.
  For the most part it&#39;s cool, but the syntax looks the same sometimes for both
  log level and appender assignments. I&#39;ve updated my previous posts on
  <a href="/2008/09/grails-logging/">debug logging</a>
  and
  <a href="/2008/09/grails-stacktracelog/">stacktrace.log</a>.
  For the record, included below is the complete log4j closure I&#39;m now using for
  a new Grails 1.1 project (or
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/log4jdsl.txt">download</a>
  it). Append this to the default <code>Config.groovy</code> file.</p>

            2009-03-25          <p>Sigh. The ubiquitous utility <strong>less</strong> does a really bad and hard to understand
  thing. For some time now, it behaves not just as a reader but also a writer:
  it writes a history file (specified by the environment variable <code>LESSHISTFILE</code>
  which is <code>$HOME/.lesshst</code> by default). If <strong>you</strong> want less to be <strong>writing</strong>
  things, fine, but don&#39;t force it on <strong>me</strong>! This has caused some annoying
  problems that have been really hard to finally trace back to less.</p>

            2008-10-07          <p>I recently refactored another developer&#39;s code to clean up some massive
  amounts of database pings to retrieve the current user object. The main
  problem was in the use of the logged_in_user or current_user idiom in Rails.

            2008-10-01          <p>The default generated error.gsp view in Grails displays the stacktrace for any
  exceptions that occur. That&#39;s nice for debugging in a development environment
  but it is a security issue for production as it is
  <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Error_Handling">information leakage</a>.
  We can easily turn this off when not in development, and do something useful
  like redirect to the application homepage.</p>

            2008-09-30          <p>Grails 1.0.x started creating a <code>stacktrace.log</code> file in the directory where
  the servlet container starts. In a development environment, using
  <code>grails run-app</code>, that&#39;s simple enough--- it appears in the top level of your
  application. In a production environment, this becomes a problem. Your
  production container (e.g. Tomcat) may start someplace where it can&#39;t create
  files, like <code>/</code>. Thus you get exceptions sent to your container&#39;s log files
  like:</p>

            2008-09-24          <p>To turn on display of debug log messages in Grails 1.0.2, add this to the
  bottom of <code>grails-app/conf/Config.groovy</code>:</p>

  talk about testing and have some example test methods but fail to describe some
  simple but necessary mechanics to get it going. The test methods should be in
  a class that extends <code>GroovyTestCase</code> (that word doesn&#39;t appear at all when
  searching the Grails website). The class name must end with <code>Tests</code> since it
  must be in a file with a name ending in <code>Tests.groovy</code> under the <code>test</code>
  directory of your grails project.</p>

            2008-09-11          <p>The default Fluxbox startup file at <code>~/.fluxbox/startup</code> is run by
  startfluxbox and has embedded comments describing how to add applications
  (&quot;apps&quot;) to run before Fluxbox starts up. The startup file can be fixed to
  also run apps after Fluxbox starts or after Fluxbox finishes. You might run
  apps after Fluxbox startup to be sure that Fluxbox applies its window
  position/decoration settings or puts the programs in the slit. Running apps
  after Fluxbox finishes is useful to cleanup things that were started earlier.
  The example startup file given below covers both situations.</p>
