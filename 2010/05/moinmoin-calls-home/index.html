        <p>While on a ship at sea, I was using Moinmoin wiki to record some local
documentation. We had internet (usually, except when the ship pointed a
certain direction), but it was a bit slow and expensive. So I was annoyed to
discover that Moinmoin was calling home in several places.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Mostly it's in the
Help documentation, illustrating how to do external linking via <code>{{...}}</code>
embedding. It was still annoying and tended to lock up my web browser while I
was trying to get local help when the internet link was down. Here's the list
of offending underlays I found in 1.8.7:</p>
<pre><code>HelpOnCreoleSyntax/revisions/00000001
HelpOnLinking/revisions/00000001
HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax/revisions/00000001
MoinMoin/revisions/00000001
WikiCourse(2f)17(20)External(20)links/revisions/00000001
WikiSandBox/revisions/00000001
</code></pre>
<p>I <a href="http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinBugs/1.8CallsHome">reported the situation</a>,
but the developers don't seem to care about even placing a warning in the
documentation.</p>
